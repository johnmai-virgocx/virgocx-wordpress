	"Bitcoin_intro": "Bitcoin can be defined as a type of digital currency or cryptocurrency. It is the first and biggest cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization in the crypto space. It was developed based on blockchain technology. The domain Bitcoin.org was registered in August 2008, shortly after which the Bitcoin whitepaper was published online by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity is still not known. The whitepaper gave us the first glimpse at the concept behind Bitcoin blockchain, a digital currency that could be used for peer-to-peer transactions over the internet. Bitcoin's genesis block had a reward of 50 BTC, and it is widely accepted as the world's first and largest established cryptocurrency. ",
	"0x_intro":"0x is an Ethereum token that is used to power the 0x protocol. To this end, the protocol features its own token, ZRX, for governance and operation. Founded in 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali, the two envisioned a platform where anything, from stocks to gold to even video game currencies, could be tokenized and be listed on an exchange. Prior to the project, Warren had worked in several research roles and was briefly the technical advisor to Basic Attention Token (BAT). Bandeali is an alumnus of the University of Illinois and was in several trading positions before co-founding 0x. Today, the team is composed of over 30 individuals, with engineers, researchers, and designers, who are constantly at work to update the platform and keep it running smoothly. Since its launch in 2017, several platforms have been built on 0x including Nuo, Matcha, Tokenlon, MetaMask, Augur, DeFi Saver, and more.",
	"Aave_intro":"Aave is an open source, non-custodial, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol based on the Ethereum network that facilitates a decentralized platform without intermediaries. Aave protocol is run by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO and is governed by the community. The native token of the platform is AAVE, which is a governance token. Under the current V2 governance model, token holders can: create a new Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP), update risk parameters, add new liquidity markets, delegate voting rights, delegate proposal creation, among others. The governance rights belong to both AAVE and stkAAVE token holders, where the latter represents the staked version of AAVE tokens that are locked up. The platform does not currently require any Know Your Customer (KYC) process to enter any  agreements on its platform for retail users but did launch a KYC-enabled permissioned liquidity pools under Aave Pro (rebranded as Aave Arc) for Institutional clients to access regulated DeFi. You can learn more about Aave by visiting their FAQ here. ",
	"Alchemy Pay_intro": "Alchemy Pay is a solution that aims to provide clients with a hybrid gateway, facilitating the transaction of fiat and cryptocurrencies. Built on Ethereum, this infrastructure is supported using the native ACH token. While many protocols that deal with the exchange of fiat into crypto (or vice versa) do so using dApps, Alchemy Pay is unique in that it is bringing tangible, real-world assets to bring forward the integration of crypto into our society. For example, some of their primary offerings include a Smart POS for crypto, a Crypto Payment Gateway, and an in-app Payment SDK for merchants. For consumers, they also launched a series of virtual crypto-linked credit cards in collaboration with Mastercard and Visa.  Where other projects view fiat currency as a detriment to cryptocurrency, Alchemy Pay ecosystem is unique in that it chooses to be a bridge between the two worlds, building interfaces that allow the two to merge together – like alchemy!  ",
	"Algorand_intro": "Algorand is an open-source, proof-of-stake blockchain network that supports the creation of financial products and applications. ALGO is the native token that contributes to the blockchain’s stability and the overall ecosystem. ALGO can be used as payment and enables holders to participate in network governance. ",
	"Amp_intro": "Amp is a new digital collateral token that offers instant and verifiable assurances for value transfer. Amp allows networks to secure transactions for a vast array of assets and related use cases irreversibly. Amp was created as a result of a collaboration between Flexa and ConsenSys, with its staking platform supporting instant and verifiable collateralization of almost any type of value transfer. This could range from digital assets, physical assets, or multi-asset. ",
	"Ankr_intro": "Ankr was founded to simplify the adoption of Web3 through a platform that allows users to deploy nodes on Proof-of-Stake blockchains, enable them to utilize their tokens, and access DeFi applications. Since its inception, Ankr has made a niche for itself, creating a marketplace for cloud services through the utilization of shared resources. While running a Proof-of-Stake node could seem like a viable source of income, it requires significant investments in the hardware side of things and requires considerable technical proficiency, both of which can act as a significant barrier to entry. Ankr addresses the challenges such as a high entry barrier by simplifying the node creation process, giving users the ability to deploy blockchain nodes at a lower price than other options available in the market. Due to the utilization of shared resources, hosting on Ankr also removes any potential problems that could crop up with a high level of centralization or a single point of failure. Ankr is aiming to create a marketplace and infrastructure platform for Web3, allowing end-users and resource providers to connect to DeFi apps and blockchain seamlessly. Ankr’s cloud infrastructure is powered through distributed power centres that greatly increase stability and resilience.",
	"ApeCoin_intro": "ApeCoin (APE) is an Ethereum-based governance and utility token used to support ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. This project is inspired by bored ape yacht club. ApeCoin token holders own and operate the community by voting, building Web3 games and services among other things. ",
	"API3_intro": "Originally launching in December 2020, API3 was brought to life by three main people, the first of which being Heikki Vanttinen. He was previously founder and CEO of CLC group, a blockchain lab that developed smart contract solutions, and was also the chief marketing officer at Zippie, a mobile operating system that specialized in blockchain adoption. The second key person to the API3 team is Burak Benligiray, who had previously worked at CLC group as the CTO. One of the main projects that CLC group had produced was “Honeycomb,” which was an predecessor to the current integration platform for API3, ChainAPI. The third co-founder is Sasa Milic, who is currently a regular lecturer at our resident University of Toronto, teaching core curriculum courses to computer science students. Among her other qualifications include being a software engineer for Facebook and as a data scientist for Gauntlet.",
	"Audius_intro": "Audius is a decentralized network specializing in the music market and uses its cryptocurrency AUDIO. The protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain and complies with the ERC20 standard. Audius is a streaming service that works similarly to Apple Music or Spotify. However, the project allows fans and music creators to interact, protect music ownership and return it to creators. The structure of Audius is strongly geared towards social media and is comparable to well-known platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. Users can scroll through their timelines and follow the latest posts from their favorite artists. TikTok users also can import sounds from Audius directly into TikTok and use them for videos.",
	"Avalanche_intro": "Created by Ava Labs, Avalanche is a layer-1 blockchain that operates as a platform for custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). As the Ethereum network is one of the leading currencies and the most popular blockchain for smart contracts, Avalanche AVAX is directly competing with the Ethereum network. It has set its target of surpassing Ethereum on that front. The platform is equipped with an elevated output of nearly 6500 transactions every second without compromising scalability. In addition, it describes itself as a programmable and open smart contracts platform for several decentralized applications.",
	"Axie Infinity_intro": "Ever since the launch of the Ethereum-based pet collector Cryptokitties, blockchain gaming has always been on the mind of developers. Several similar projects have been created, but none of them have come even close to the scale of Axie Infinity AXS. With a market cap of nearly US$9 billion, Axie Infinity is by far the most successful blockchain gaming project to ever hit the market. Heavily inspired by the beloved Pokemon series, the gameplay of Axie Infinity combines the breeding and creature collection introduced by Cryptokitties with open-ended gameplay that lets you trade AXS, raise, and battle creatures called Axies. What makes it unique, however, is that every single Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT). As such, each Axie holds its own monetary value. Designed to provide users with a fun, accessible, and educational way to gain exposure to the capabilities of blockchain technology, Axie Infinity has become one of the most popular blockchain projects in the globe, and has been the number one NFT collection on CryptoSlam for quite some time now.",
	"Basic Attention Token_intro": "The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a token that is revolutionizing the digital advertising and rewards industry.  The token is designed to disintermediate web-based advertising to literally reward users for their attention, while providing digital advertisers with a greater ROI on ad spend. The BAT token is the native currency of the Brave browser ecosystem. The entire mechanism and token distribution of the BAT token is natively delivered through the Brave Web Browser, which is three times faster than Google Chrome browser, uses 35% less battery, and is an open-source, privacy-focused browser. Brave browser is designed to block invasive cookies, malware, and ad trackers, while using blockchain technology to anonymize and securely track specific user attention, where access is granted, which ultimately results in rewards for publishers. ",
	"Bitcoin_Cash_intro": "On the 1st of August 2017, a small section of the Bitcoin community decided to initiate a hard fork and break away from the main Bitcoin blockchain, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Leading up to this, Bitcoin was plagued with severe scalability issues that the community was trying to solve. The community could tackle the scalability problem in two ways, they could reduce the amount of data verified in each block, or the size of the block could be increased. Both methods would make transactions faster and cheaper. The Bitcoin community could not reach a consensus on how they could solve the problem, and when developers initiated the hard fork, Bitcoin Cash was created. Bitcoin Cash describes itself as a peer-to-peer electronic cash for the internet. It is entirely decentralized and independent of any third parties such as governments, banks, or other financial institutions. Don’t confuse this with Bitcoin’s definition of “peer-to-peer” transactions because Bitcoin Cash focuses on carrying out more transactions than Bitcoin, to be used as a medium that enables transactions quickly. Several features differentiate Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin. ● Bitcoin Cash has an increased block size of 8 MB ● Bitcoin Cash does not have segregated witness (segwit) ● It does not have the “replace by fee” feature ● It can process more transactions per second than Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash was a hard fork of Bitcoin. This meant that any user who had BTC would get an equal amount in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), provided they did not have their currency in an exchange and had possession of their private keys when the developers initiated the hard fork. ",
	"Cardano_intro": "Cardano (ADA) utilizes a layered architecture to facilitate smart contracts while also offering better scalability. Users on the Cardano blockchain can use the platform’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, to carry out transactions. Cardano has often been described as a third-generation protocol that improves upon the scalability and energy consumption problems of first and second-generation protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cardano is the only blockchain with all its peer-reviewed protocols, helping the blockchain tackle any potential issues. Cardano is backed by several organizations that are working together on the development of the platform. The three main organizations are Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. ",
	"Chainlink_intro": "Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that functions as middleware between on-chain and off-chain systems. The networks provide access to real world data feeds from off-chain sources and allow these to become inputs in smart contracts via oracles. Smart contracts are simply a pre-specified set of conditional rules or agreements on the blockchain that execute certain actions if certain conditions are met, based on information. Think of a smart contract as an IF Statement in Excel or simply as “if X is true/false, then execute Y.” Typically, smart contracts rely on information that is available on the blockchain as the input, but to craft smart contracts that go beyond the cryptosphere, they will require off-chain or real-world data feeds as inputs. This is where oracles are useful, as an oracle is ‘middleware’ software that acts as an intermediary that translates real world data to a smart contract on a blockchain and vice versa.  A simple way to think about Chainlink then is to imagine a security token that relies on real-time stock market price feeds, or a blockchain based sports betting platform that relies on live sports scores, these can be achieved using Chainlink oracles to bridge the gap between real world data and on-chain smart contracts or crypto assets. ",
	"Chiliz_intro": "Chiliz leverages blockchain technology to build up a direct and transparent engagement that enable sports fan to support their favourite teams.  Chiliz operates socios.com, a blockchain-based sport entertainment platform. Fans can buy fan tokens by utilizing Chiliz (CHZ), the native cryptocurrency on Chiliz, to participate in governances such as uniforms, songs and other decision-making processes. ",
	"Compound_intro": "Compound (COMP) is an algorithmic, decentralized, autonomous interest rate protocol running on the Ethereum blockchain that was built for developers to unlock an entire universe of decentralized financial (DeFi) applications. The Compound protocol is simply a decentralized money market protocol that deploys lending pools to facilitate various crypto loans. The interest rates used for the loans on the platform are dynamic and based on the simple economics of supply and demand for each Cryptoasset. The interest rate are produced with every block mined. It is also important to note that borrowers can pay back loans at any time and locked assets, or collateral can be withdrawn at any time. Decentralized finance protocols like Compound are permissionless and open source by design. This encourages and allows developers to assemble and unite various DeFi protocols together in different combinations to create more complex financial structures to further build out the DeFi ecosystem and add more layers of versatility and usability. ",
	"Cosmos_intro": "The Cosmos Network facilitates scaling, communication, and interoperation between separate chains, allowing different chains to transact. Often referred to as the “internet of blockchains,” Cosmos ecosystem is looking to bring together different blockchains within a single platform that would help solve the key issues that plague blockchain technology, namely scalability, usability, interoperability, and sovereignty. Cosmos’s focus on customizability and interoperability sets it apart from other projects in the same space.  Cosmos does not prioritize its network; instead, it focuses on creating an ecosystem and Cosmos hub of networks capable of sharing data and transactions programmatically, without the involvement of any central authority party to the deal or activity. The platform focuses on compatibility with other blockchains, allowing it to interact with other projects, blockchains, and cryptocurrencies. Different projects look to establish themselves as the leading light in their specific space or industry. With different projects spread across different areas, the interaction between blockchains and individual blockchain objects becomes very difficult. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot communicate directly, and the same applies to several other blockchains. This situation leads to blockchains being isolated from each other and unable to communicate or share information in any convenient manner. Cosmos looks to create and maintain a link between different projects and blockchains and tries to open blockchains to features such as cross-chains of smart contracts and exchange tokens directly between two projects or exchanges without the involvement of a third party or an external exchange.  Cosmos also acts as a complete technology stack that allows a streamlined development process allowing developers to create their own custom blockchains. ",
	"Crypterium_intro": "Crypterium is a mobile cryptobank that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance. It allows users to buy and spend cryptocurrencies using their bank cards. The app also offers trading, spending, savings, among other banking services. CRPT is an ERC-20 token that empowers the whole ecosystem. ",
	"Curve_intro": "Curve DAO Token is a well-known automated market maker (AMM) platform that provides a very efficient means to exchange tokens while keeping cheaper fees and little slippage by only accepting liquidity pools made up of assets that behave similarly. Curve incentivizes their involvement by integrating with other DeFi protocols and offering rewards in the form of CRV tokens and interest, while this strategy results in lower fees for the liquidity providers who provide the pools with tokens. Instead of trading between buyers and sellers, automated market makers use liquidity pools to allow digital assets to be traded automatically. A liquidity pool is essentially a shared fund of tokens. Tokens are supplied by users to liquidity pools, and the prices of the tokens in the pool are set by a mathematical formula. Liquidity pools can be optimized for various reasons by modifying the formula. By giving tokens to an AMM's liquidity pool, anyone with an internet connection and some ERC-20 tokens can become a liquidity provider. For giving tokens to the liquidity pool, liquidity providers typically earn a fee (paid by traders who engage with the liquidity pool). CRV derives value and utility in many way: 1.The CRV token serves as a reward that can be staked or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges for providing liquidity to the pools on the platform. 2.It is also Curve's governance token that has a time weighted voting and value accrual mechanism. This gives the CRV token three main use cases: staking, boosting, and voting. ",

	"Ocean Protocol_intro": "Ocean Protocol is built to make digitized information and the commercialization of this data more secure and efficient, allowing individuals and businesses to take control of their data, creating value and monetizing it by transforming it into a token.  Built using Ethereum, Ocean Protocol uses ‘datatokens,’ ERC-20 tokens that gate access to data. These tokens are redeemable by users that need information stored within them. Data providers can start selling data access to interested parties on the Ocean Protocol marketplace while enjoying the security and provenance benefits assured by the blockchain. This means that, since practically anyone can convert their data into a token, Ocean Protocol has the potential to support a huge data marketplace.   There are currently two main Ocean Protocol functions: the Data Ecosystem Platform and the Data Marketplace. The Ecosystem Platform facilitates data access control and allows data providers to upload and store their data without sacrificing control when monetizing it for buyers. The platform thus includes the backbone of the network, including the Ocean chain, the smart contracts, and software development kits.  The Ocean Market, on the other hand, is an automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates the minting and exchange of datatokens; in a way it functions like a decentralized exchange. In contrast to the traditional ‘order book’ style trading seen on traditional exchanges, AMMs use a collection of liquidity pools (much like Uniswap) that allow each trade to settle through sets of smart contracts.   ",

	"PAX_Gold_intro": "Pax Gold (PAXG) is a commodity-backed stablecoin issued by the Paxos Trust Company. Each PAX Gold token is backed by one fine troy ounce (1 t oz) of a 400 t oz London Gold Delivery gold bar, kept in Brink’s vaults and managed by Paxos. PAX Gold is the first of its kind – it is the first cryptocurrency token that is backed by physical gold bars. PAX Gold allows for accessible exposure to gold markets without using ETFs, futures contracts, or other similar ventures. Gold has a long, enduring role as a commodity in human history and, more recently, is valued for its natural capabilities as a non-oxidizing conductor as well as for being a hedge against price fluctuations in the economy. Traditionally, gold in its purest form is heavy and difficult to transport in large quantities. With this in mind, Paxos offers their gold-based cryptocurrency token backed by professional gold vaults in London, allowing PAX Gold to be redeemable for physical London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) accredited gold. What this means is that PAX Gold is essentially a custodial service, meaning that purchasing a token is an IOU of physical gold bars, redeemable by London’s gold vaults. The Paxos Trust Company is a New York-based financial institution specializing in blockchain technology. Founded in 2012 by Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo, Paxos Trust Company was originally a Bitcoin exchange called itBit. This exchange was one of the first to be licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, granting them the ability to be a custodian and offer exchange services for customers in the US. When they changed their name to Paxos in 2015, they were also granted by the New York State Department a limited-purpose trust charter, making them the first company in the US to be approved and regulated to offer cryptocurrency products and services.

The platform expands the crypto ecosystem's exposure to non-blockchain assets, resulting in a more mature financial sector. Synthetix allows for almost any asset that has a consistent pricing mechanism to be given blockchain based (on-chain) exposure. The platform consists of a dual token model comprised of a token that represents the synthetic asset or Synth (e.g., sUSD, sEUR,sXAU, etc.) and a collateral token, called, SNX or Synthetic Network Token. It’s important to note that the protocol has its own stablecoin, sUSD. It’s important to make one thing clear. Synthetic assets or synths are not the same as fiat or asset backed stablecoins. For example, USDC or BUSD are backed by fiat and each token digitally represents 1 USD held in reserve. Another example would be Paxos, where 1 PAX Gold or PAXG token is backed by a single fine troy ounce (t oz) and stored in a vault. It represents ownership of the underlying physical gold. Synths do not require you to own the underlying asset, as it merely represents exposure to the price movement of the underlying asset. This is critical to note. Synthetix allows for almost any asset that has a consistent pricing mechanism to be given blockchain based (on-chain) exposure. The platform consists of a dual token model comprised of a token that represents the synthetic asset or Synth (e.g., sUSD, sEUR,sXAU, etc.) and a collateral token, called, SNX or Synthetix Network Token.
